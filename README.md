# Analysis-for-Australian-Population
This is a website created for visualising the Australian population and its future. Right now only the dataset is available, but that will be adjusted further when we have more time to create the website.

In the meantime, there would be an analysis on Python (with charts and explanation), to show the change of population in Australia.
